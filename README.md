# UZH Software Construction HS17

This is a copy of the private repository that holds the MLGenerator which was implemented in EiffelStudio for the course Software Construction in the Fall Semester of 2017. The project was done under the supervision of Raphael Matile and in a group of four students. 

## What  can our MLGenerator do?
Our Generator is implemented as a library and should assist the user with creating web pages. It allows adding all the elements which are needed for a proper page, which includes, paragraphs, text semantics, images, code snippets, headings, tables, list (unordered as well as ordered) and as well as links like external, internal and anchor links.
Currently, HTML is supported but due to the extendability of our library, additional languages can be added, easily by adding additional Visitor for each new language.


## Project Work

This project was the first opportunity for us to take part in creating a software from start to beginning. It was split into Milestones which consisted of: SRS, Design Patterns/Diagram, Implementation, Testing

## Evaluation
The Project passed successfully and was graded 89.5/100 marks. It served as a great learning and team work opportunity and gave us a glimpse into how things work later on in the professional life.
