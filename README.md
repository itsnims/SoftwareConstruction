# UZH Software Construction HS17

This repisatory holds our MLGenerator which was implemented for the course Software Construction in the Fall Semester of 2017. The project was done under the supervision of Raphael Matile.


## What  can our MLGenerator do?
Our Generator is implemented as a library and should assist the user with creating web pages. It allows adding all the elements which are needed for a proper page, which includes, paragraphs, text semantics, images, code snippets, headings, tables, list (unordered as well as ordered) and as well as links like external, internal and anchor links.
Currently, HTML is supported but due to the extendability of our library, addiditonal languages can be added.
